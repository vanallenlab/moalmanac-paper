Counts of clinically relevant molecular features by cohort, feature type, and evidence for disease prognosis associations for retrospective cohorts.

![Supplementary Figure 18](supplementary-figure-18.png)

Counts of observed molecular features associated with therapeutic resistance categorized as putatively actionable (exactly matching a fully characterized genomic event catalogued in MOAlmanac) or investigate actionability (partial match) by evidence tier for metastatic melanomas (n = 110), mCRPC / SU2C (n = 150), kidney papillary renal-cell carcinoma (n = 100), and osteosarcoma (n = 59).
