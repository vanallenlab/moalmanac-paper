Counts of clinically relevant molecular features labeled by PHIAL & TARGET vs Molecular Oncology Almanac by feature type.

![Supplementary Figure 4](supplementary-figure-04.png)

Counts of molecular features by feature type labeled as either putatively actionable or investigate actionability, thus being associated with a clinical action, by PHIAL & TARGET vs Molecular Oncology Almanac. Differences resulted from improved handling of genomic features (e.g. percentile approach for copy number instead of thresholded), expanded evidence (MOAlmanac contains more relationships between molecular features and clinical relationships), and expanded feature types (whereas PHIAL & TARGET only included somatic variants and copy number alterations, MOAlmanac contains more). This does not include “Biologically Relevant” features from MOAlmanac or “High Priority” from PHIAL & TARGET, neither of which are directly associated with clinical assertions.
