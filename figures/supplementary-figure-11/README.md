For each patient, the number of therapies administered in I-PREDICT are shown (left, blue) and the number of sensitive therapies highlighted by MOAlmanac (right, red). Therapies and associated molecular features targeted were mapped to therapeutic strategies for those administered in I-PREDICT and those highlighted by MOAlmanac (center, purple). A shared therapeutic strategy was observed in 39 (47%) of patients, 31 of which involved a therapy most prioritized for the patient by MOAlmanac.
