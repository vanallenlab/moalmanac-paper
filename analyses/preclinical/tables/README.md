# Tables
This folder contains result tables. The `features/` folder contains several sample x feature boolean tables that were used to calculate genomic distance, found under `distances/`. There are a few other files in this directory.
- `models.evaluated.pkl`, is a [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html) of the complete output from matchmaking of trying different models.
- `models.performance.txt`, is a summary table that lists mean average precision and average precision @ k = 1-5 for models, as well as a plaintext description of how the model is approaching similarity. This is also `Supplementary Table 7.xlsx`.
- `models.random.evaluated.pkl`, is likewise as the above pickle except for random models, which was generated by shuffling cell lines over 100,000 seeds. The seed with the mAP closest to the mean was used as well as +/- one standard deviation.
- `pairwise-model-comparison.txt`, is the output from `07.model.significance.ipynb`. Significance testing is performed to see if models are in the noise range of each other. P-values greater than 0.05 are within the noise range of each other. This is also `Supplementary Table 7.xlsx`.
- `random.mAP-by-seed.txt`, is the output from `06.evaluate-monkey-matchmaking.ipynb`. It is a table of seed values and mAP results, after shuffling cell lines with those seeds.
