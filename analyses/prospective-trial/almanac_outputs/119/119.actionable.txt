Investigate Actionability	Preclinical		Clinical evidence	Somatic Variant	ARID1A	Frameshift	p.R1026fs*13						Investigate Actionability	Durvalumab	PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition	Immunotherapy	Loss of function ARID1A mutations may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade, particularly PD-L1 inhibition. Anti-PD-L1 antibody reduced tumor mutational burden and prolonged survival of mice ARID1A-deficient but not ARID1A-wild-type ovarian tumors.	Shen J, Ju Z, Zhao W, et al. ARID1A deficiency promotes mutability and potentiates therapeutic antitumor immunity unleashed by immune checkpoint blockade. Nat Med. 2018;24(5):556-562.	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0012-z								Investigate Actionability	0	ARID1A mutations were associated with poorer prognosis in a study of 109 microdissected pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors.
