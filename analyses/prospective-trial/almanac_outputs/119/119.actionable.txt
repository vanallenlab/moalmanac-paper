Investigate Actionability - High	Preclinical		Clinical evidence	Somatic Variant	ARID1A	Frameshift	p.R1026fs*13						Investigate Actionability - High	Durvalumab	Immunotherapy	Loss of function ARID1A mutations may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade, particularly PD-L1 inhibition. Anti-PD-L1 antibody reduced tumor mutational burden and prolonged survival of mice ARID1A-deficient but not ARID1A-wild-type ovarian tumors.	Shen J, Ju Z, Zhao W, et al. ARID1A deficiency promotes mutability and potentiates therapeutic antitumor immunity unleashed by immune checkpoint blockade.
