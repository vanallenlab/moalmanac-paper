Investigate Actionability	Preclinical			Somatic Variant	FBXW7	Missense	p.R465H						Investigate Actionability	Sirolimus	PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibition	Targeted therapy	Breast cancer tumor cell lines harboring deletions or mutations in FBXW7 are particularly sensitive to rapamycin treatment, FBXW7 may be a biomarker for human cancers susceptible to treatment with inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.
