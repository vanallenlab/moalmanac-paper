Investigate Actionability - High	FDA-Approved	Preclinical	Inferential	Copy Number	ERBB2	Amplification							Investigate Actionability - High	Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine	Targeted therapy	HER2-targeted antibody and microtubule inhibitor conjugate indicated, as a single agent, for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Patients should have either: (1) Received prior therapy for metastatic disease, or (2) Developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant therapy.
