We evaluated 150 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC) for clinical actionability based on the Molecular Oncology Almanac and compared findings relative to PHIAL and TARGET. Tumor and normal whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq were processed on the Broad Institute and Verily's [Terra platform](https://app.terra.bio/) that sits atop Google Cloud.
