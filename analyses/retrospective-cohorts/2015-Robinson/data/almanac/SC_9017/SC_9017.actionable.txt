Putatively Actionable			Clinical evidence	Copy Number	RB1	Deletion				0.0	0.0														Putatively Actionable	0.0	Deletion of chromosome 13 seems to have an amplifying effect on cell cycle gene expression and is reported to be associated with short event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). This copy loss event results in haploinsufficiency of RB1 and other genes mapped to chromosome 13.	National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
