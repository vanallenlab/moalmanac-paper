PLoS ONE. 2013;8(4):e60408.	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0060408								Investigate Actionability	0.0	A cohort of men with localized prostate cancer was followed and a statistically significant association between the presense of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and prostate cancer specific death was observed. Prostate cancer with this fusion may be of a more aggressive phenotype.	Demichelis F, Fall K, Perner S, et al.
