We evaluated 59 pediatric patients with osteosarcoma (OS) for clinical actionability based on the Molecular Oncology Almanac and compared findings relative to PHIAL and TARGET. Tumor and normal whole-exome sequencing (WES, n=59) and RNA-seq (n=34) were processed on the Broad Institute and Verily's [Terra platform](https://app.terra.bio/) that sits atop Google Cloud.
