Putatively Actionable	Clinical trial			Copy Number	BRCA2	Deletion				0.0	0.0		Putatively Actionable	Olaparib	PARP inhibition	Targeted therapy	Patients with chemotherapy-refractory prostate cancer have higher response rates to PARP inhibitor therapy in the presence of DNA repair mutations, particularly concomittant with platinum-sensitive disease. Platinum-resistant disease partially abrogates olaparib sensitvity in the setting of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.	Mateo J, Carreira S, Sandhu S, et al.
