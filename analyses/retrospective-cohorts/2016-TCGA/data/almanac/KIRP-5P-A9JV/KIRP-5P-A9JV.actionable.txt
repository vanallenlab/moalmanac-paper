Investigate Actionability	Inferential			Mutational Signature	COSMIC Signature 4	version 2	0.32						Investigate Actionability	Pembrolizumab	PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition	Immunotherapy	"In a cohort of 34 non-small cell lung cancer patients with pembrolizumab, the presence of a smoking signature (""transversion-high"" tumors) was associated with a higher overall response rate (56% in transversion-high tumors, vs. 17% in ""transversion-low"" [never-smoker] tumors), a higher rate of DCB (77% vs. 22%), and a longer PFS."
