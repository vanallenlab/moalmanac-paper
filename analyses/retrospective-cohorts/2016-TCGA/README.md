We evaluated 100 patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma for clinical actionability based on the Molecular Oncology Almanac and compared findings relative to PHIAL and TARGET. Tumor and normal whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq were processed on the Broad Institute and Verily's [Terra platform](https://app.terra.bio/) that sits atop Google Cloud.
