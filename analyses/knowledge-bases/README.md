- `civic-oncokb/` lists knowledge base comparisons between CIViC, OncoKB, and MOAlmanac. 
- `count-cgc-genes/` simply counts genes in CGC
- `moalmanac-db/` corresponds to the [2021 Feb 4 release](https://github.com/vanallenlab/moalmanac-db/releases/tag/v.2021-02-04) of the database. This is the version used in this publication. The database can also be fetched with `download-moalmanac-db.sh`.
