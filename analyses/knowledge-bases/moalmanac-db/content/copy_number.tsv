RB1	Deletion	13	Multiple Myeloma		Multiple Myeloma	MM						0	Guideline	Deletion of chromosome 13 seems to have an amplifying effect on cell cycle gene expression and is reported to be associated with short event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). This copy loss event results in haploinsufficiency of RB1 and other genes mapped to chromosome 13.		Guideline	"National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
