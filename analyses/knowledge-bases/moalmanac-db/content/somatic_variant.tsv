NRAS	1										Melanoma	Metastatic	Melanoma	MEL						0	Clinical evidence	A retrospective study of 677 metastatic melanoma patients found that patients with BRAF and NRAS mutations had a higher risk of CNS involvement at diagnosis of stage IV disease (24% of BRAF and 23% of NRAS compared to 12% WT). Non-uveal melanoma patients tested for mutations within a median 6 months of diagnosis (n=313) showed an association between BRAF and NRAS mutation and a shorter survival (median 8.2 months vs. 15.1 months).
