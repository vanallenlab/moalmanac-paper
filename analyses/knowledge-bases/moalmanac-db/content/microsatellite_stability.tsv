MSI-High	Colorectal Cancer	Metastatic	Colorectal Adenocarcinoma	COADREAD	Pembrolizumab	PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition	Immunotherapy	1			Clinical trial	A phase II study of 32 colorectal cancer patients (and 9 noncolorectal cancer patients) found an association between mismatch repair deficiency (measured by MSI status) and both immune-related objective response rate (40% of patients with MSI-High vs. 0% in MSI-Low) and immune-related progression-free survival rate (78% of MSI-High patients at 20 weeks vs. 11% in MSI-Low). Post-hoc cohort comparison showed hazard ratio for disease progression or death of 0.10 and for death of 0.22.		Journal	"Le DT, Uram JN, Wang H, et al.
