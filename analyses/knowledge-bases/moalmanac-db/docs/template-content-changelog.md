# Template for Content Changelog
Use the following template for monthly entries in the content changelog. You can also look at [prior releases](/docs/content-changelog.md) for examples, too. Items should be sorted by descending evidence level and then alphabetically by feature name. 

## {Month} {Year} release
{Overall description of release}.

Added entries:
- ({Evidence level of source}) {molecular feature(s)} {assertion} in {disease context} {ontology}.

Edited entries:
- ({Evidence level of source}) {molecular feature(s)} {assertion} in {disease context} {ontology}. {description of change}.

Removed entries:
- ({Evidence level of source}) {molecular feature(s)} {assertion} in {disease context} {ontology}. {rationale for removal}.
